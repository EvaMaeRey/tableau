In this walk-through we will see some data prep moves.  Moving variable first understood as measures to dimensions, and converting variables understood as discrete to continuous.  

--

We'll see the "small multiples" concept at work -- where the x-position represents first a category, and second a continuous variable.

--

We'll also see how to change aesthetics across the board - i.e. the *unmapped aesthetic choices* for our marks/geometric objects.  So the case, for example where color does not do any variable representation, but is just a personal choice.

## What variables are in this data set?

| variable	|value type	|description|
| :--- | ---: | ---:|
|season	|double	|Season number |
|episode|	double|	Episode number |
|title	|character|	Title of episode |
|imdb_rating	|double	|IMDB Rating (10 is best) |
|total_votes	|double	|Total votes by users |
|air_date	|date|	Original air date |

Note: In Tableau double is called "decimal" - it is a numeric variable that allows for values beyond the counting numbers (integers - ggplot and Tableau use the same terminology).

For more description visit the [#TidyTuesday homepage](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2020/2020-03-17/readme.md) for this data set.

# Additional topics for lecture that didn't make it into the walk through.

- Also talk about titles icon.  Plot title, summary, and caption.
- Filter/deleting marks

## Notes on ways to improve references such as this

- The marks shelf needs to be wider such that you can see the entire variable name --- like SUM(Number of Records).  This pill is cut off in the walk-through.


```{css, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE}
