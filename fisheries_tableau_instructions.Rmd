In this walk-through, you'll practice some of your tableau skills.  The data is the same as for your ggplot2 assignment this week. 

---

The [data](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EvaMaeRey/ggplot2_grammar_guide/master/exercises/fisheries.csv) is made available via the [#TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) project.  

Save the data and load it into tableau. 

- Build a choropleth map (filled political boundaries) where color represents Capture or Aquaculture.  
- Adjust the color palette from the default. 

Also:

- Build a scatterplot, aquaculture v. capture.  Add labels to all the points.  Have color represent the variable peru_or_chile.  Select your own colors for that discrete scale.
