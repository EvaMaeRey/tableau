```{r setup, include = F}
# This is the recommended set up for flipbooks
# you might think about setting cache to TRUE as you gain practice --- building flipbooks from scracth can be time consuming
knitr::opts_chunk$set(fig.width = 8, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, comment = "", cache = T, fig.retina = 3, out.width = "100%")

In this walk-through, you'll practice some of your tableau skills.  The data is the same as for your ggplot2 assignment this week. 

---

The [data](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EvaMaeRey/ggplot2_grammar_guide/master/exercises/fisheries.csv) is made available on Github. 

Save the data and load it into Tableau.  It is a .csv file, so you will load it via "text" portal.

### In Tableau

- Build a choropleth map (filled political boundaries) where color represents Capture or Aquaculture.  
- Then, *adjust the color palette from the default.*

--

Also:

- Build a scatterplot, aquaculture v. capture.  
- Add labels to the points  
- Have color represent the variable peru_or_chile.  
- Select your own colors for that discrete color scale.  
- Adjust the x and y scale to log10 scale


---

## Recall:

--

We sometimes need to adjust how Tableau interprets variables.

--

"Measures" are aggregates of our variables, and we sometimes need to drag that variable up to the "Dimensions" shelf.  

--

Additionally, variables may need to be converted from discrete to continous.  This will be the case in these examples.
